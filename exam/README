Use sample.tex for a working example. Command names and comments should be
fairly obvious and no one reads this file anyway.

Some technical (?) details:

 - Greatest challenge of all is fitting 6 questions per half A4 page.
   You might have to jump through metaphorical hoops to fit question
   sets with a lot of code.

 - Page looks like crap because of above point. Margins are absurdly small.

 - Enumerate has been redefined to waste less space. Exercise numbers
   are bolded to stand out.

 - Grids and question lists are generated with for loops. Pure
   awesomeness.

 - "Header" (i.e. the logos) looks like crap; we should use a hline to
   separate it from the rest of the text, but that wastes valuable
   space.

 - We use minipages for "two sets per page" cases; do not use footnotes,
   there might be dragons there.

For support, contact me at the address at the top of this file.
